The Foundation Theme
====================

Watch and compile .scss files to css:

```
cd styles
sass --watch main.scss:main.css
```

HTML code for application form comes from Office Autopilot. Form code is in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tessalt/f11d652cfd88ba86102e). Must be minified before being pasted into WordPress.
